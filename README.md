A LOG ON HOW TO GET GITHUB APP WORKING.

First. Clone this project.

Then, open the code directory in a terminal and run the following...<br/>
npm install <br/>
npm react-native-icon-material-design <br/>
npm install @react-navigation/native <br/>
npm install @react-navigation/native-stack <br/>
npm install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context <br/>
npm install firebase <br/>
npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage <br/>
npm install @firebase/storage <br/>
npm install react-native-element-dropdown <br/>
npm install expo-image-picker <br/>

Then finally you could do npm start and then run the emulator by pressing 'a' on keyboard. <br/>
Alternatively, you could just download expo go on your apple/android device. Then you open up your camera on said device and scan the QR code that should show when you did npm start. <br/>
Hope this helps. <br/>
