A LOG ON HOW TO GET GITHUB APP WORKING.

First. Clone this project.

Then, open the code directory in a terminal and run the following...<br/>
npm install <br/>
npm react-native-ico-material-design <br/>
npm install @react-navigation/native <br/>
npm install @react-navigation/native-stack <br/>
npx expo install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context <br/>
npx expo install firebase <br/>

Then finally you could do npm start and then run the emulator by pressing 'a' on keyboard. Hope this helps
